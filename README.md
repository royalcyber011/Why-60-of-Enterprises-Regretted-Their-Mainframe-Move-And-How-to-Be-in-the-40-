Why Do 60% of Enterprises Regret Mainframe Migration?
1. Underestimating Complexity and Legacy Dependencies

Mainframes often support deeply integrated, custom-coded systems. Without a thorough assessment, migration can result in:

Â· Application incompatibilities

Â· Data integrity issues

Â· Prolonged downtime

2. Budget Overruns Due to Inadequate Planning

Surprises during migration â€” like unsupported applications, third-party licensing, or extensive retraining â€” can lead to unexpected cost escalations.

3. Security and Compliance Risks

Mainframes offer robust built-in security. Migrating to cloud or hybrid platforms without equivalent safeguards may expose your organization to:

Â· Data breaches

Â· Compliance failures (HIPAA, GDPR, SOX)

4. Performance and Scalability Challenges

New platforms may lack the processing efficiency of mainframes, leading to:

Â· Slower response times

Â· High latency

Â· Increased infrastructure costs

Hidden Costs of Mainframe Migration in 2025 (And How to Avoid Them)
Many organizations focus on direct costs â€” like hardware or licenses â€” but overlook several hidden challenges:

1. Application Refactoring

Challenge: Legacy apps often require modification for cloud compatibility. Solution: Conduct an application inventory and use automated refactoring tools.

2. Data Migration Risks

Challenge: Moving decades of historical data securely and accurately is complex. Solution: Use a phased migration approach with data validation at each step.

3. Training and Change Management

Challenge: Teams may struggle to adapt to new platforms. Solution: Invest in structured training programs and change management initiatives.

4. Post-Migration Optimization

Challenge: Performance issues and bugs often surface after go-live. Solution: Partner with experts like Royal Cyber for ongoing monitoring and optimization.
